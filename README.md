# HEXABYTE | Cyber Intelligence Hub

> *"Knowledge is defense. Defense is survival."*

HEXABYTE is an advanced **cybersecurity awareness platform** designed to train the public in spotting digital threats. By combining **randomized security simulations** with a **Llama 3.1 8B AI-powered heuristic engine**, HEXABYTE transforms passive learning into active defense.

- **Security Simulation**  
  Randomized **5-question quiz engine** drawn from a master database of **40+ real-world cybersecurity scenarios** (Phishing, Social Engineering, Network Security).

- **Safety Scoring**  
  Instant feedback with remediation advice. Users discover their personal **Security IQ** and learn corrective strategies.

- **Cyber-Gothic UI**  
  Responsive interface built with **Bootstrap 5**, styled in a **Neon-Dark aesthetic** with Glassmorphism effects.

## Architecture & Security

HEXABYTE is built with **serverless security-first architecture**:

1. Client sends the *threat payload* → `/api/analyze`.
2. API Key stored securely as an **Environment Variable** on the server.
3. Server communicates with **OpenRouter**, returns only the AI’s analysis.
4. **Result:** API Key is never exposed to the browser or dev tools.
